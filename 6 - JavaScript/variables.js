// Statements: JavaScript code is composed of statements that perform specific actions. Each statement typically ends with a semicolon (;), although it is not always required.
// Comments: You can add comments in JavaScript to provide explanations or make notes within the code. There are two types of comments: single-line comments, starting with //, and multi-line comments, enclosed between /* and */.
// Case sensitivity: JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, "variable" and "Variable" would be considered as two separate variables.
// Whitespace: JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and line breaks (collectively called whitespace) that are not necessary for code execution. However, whitespace can enhance code readability.
// Blocks: Code blocks in JavaScript are enclosed in curly braces ({}) and are used to group statements together. Blocks are often used in control structures like loops and conditional statements.


//Variable var
var firstName = "John";
console.log("Firstname:", firstName);

//Variable let
let lastName = "Doe";
console.log("Lastname:", lastName);

if (true) {
    var email = "johndoe@gmail.com";
    let userName = "johndoe";
    console.log("Email:", email);
    console.log("Username:", userName);
}


//Variable const
const birthdate = "06232000";
console.log(birthdate)
// birthdate = "000000";
